 • Implementation of pipelined 32-bit RISC MIPS processor using Verilog HDL
           ◦ Studied processor design, pipelining, and instruction set of 32-bit MIPS and implemented using Verilog HDL
           ◦ Written testbench to carry out different algebraic operations and verified the results through timing diagrams
